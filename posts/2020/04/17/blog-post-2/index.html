<div class="content-section col-lg-12 col-xl-8  text-justify">   <p><strong>Efficient Distributed SpatioTemporal Datastores for Smart Cities</strong> by Michael Wilbur</p>

<p><strong>1. Problem Context</strong></p>

<p>With the proliferation of affordable sensor and networking units,
technologies of the past are entering the connected world at a rapid
pace. The roads, buildings and appliances we rely on everyday are now
generating large scale data at a frantic pace. Within this data lies
insight to our interaction with the physical world around us only now
conceivable.</p>

<p>How do we use this data to ultimately improve the quality of life of
citizens and enhance our interactions with our urban environment?
Continuing the rate at which devices are connected is surely important,
as is the data mining and AI algorithms used to comprehend this data.
However, data collection and processing is only as good as the methods
by which we store and access this data. As the velocity, volume and
variety of this data explodes the data store architectures and methods
we deploy are the fundamental center of the future smart city.</p>

<p>Suppose a special event is to take place in a dense region of the city.
The event expects many thousands (in the case of the NFL draft…
hundreds of thousands) of people to flood an area over a couple of days.
To prepare for such an event, the analytics team needs to efficiently
aggregate historical data to provide a view of normal operating behavior
of the region within a bounding shape (ie a polygon). Additionally, city
officials want real-time monitoring and visualization application to
monitor the data as the event unfolds. Now latency is our primary
concern.</p>

<p>Now suppose we are looking to optimize energy demands in our public
transit system or optimal routing in a disaster scenario. These
applications require searching by bus route, surrounding traffic
conditions and weather.</p>

<p>As each data source maintains its own data schema, smart city data is
highly unstructured and irregular. Some applications are latency
sensitive, while others require heavy batch processing and static data
sets. In this way, client applications are closely integrated with the
data structures in which the data is stored. For this reason we outline
a modular smart city data architecture centered around a distributed log
in which structured data views (SQL, Document, Graph) can seamlessly
connect and sync with historical and real time data as needed.</p>

<p><strong>2. Understanding the problem</strong></p>

<p>While software infrastructure has long existed for shared computing and
networking (Unix/Linux and TCP/IP), no such systems exist for storage
resources. The explosive growth in the volume and velocity of data
generation in nearly every field of research has made problems of <em>data
logistics</em> (i.e. “ensuring that data [are] in the right place at the
right time and accessible by the right users”, Chard et al.)
increasingly intractable. The disparate nature of existing data stores
and the query languages to access these stores presents unique problems
for researchers tasked with sharing large scale spatiotemporal data
between colleagues in a timely way.</p>

<p>In addition to the problem of having the right data available at the
right place the researchers in the urban science initiatives have to
also deal with the inefficiencies of querying and operating on the high
volume and high velocity geospatial data. Location-aware data is a
critical component transportation, shipping and retail analytics. Google
alone generates about 25 PB of data per day, a significant portion of
which is spatiotemporal (Jiang et al.). With the advancement of mobile
technologies, the volume and velocity of spatiotemporal data poses a
unique challenge to data storage and efficient querying of this data.</p>

<p>The fundamental challenges related to distributed spatiotemporal
datastores we plan to address are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Handling high velocity/volume spatiotemporal data efficiently and
 quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow for real-time access to data for researchers and various
 applications, as well as easy transfer of aggregate datasets for
 batch processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency - provide a mechanism for strongly consistent, reliable
 storage of incoming data sources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Handling unrelated and challenging schemas. By centering our system
 around a persistent distributed log structure, optimal data stores
 can come and go as needed - providing high extensibility for the
 smart city data of the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interaction between static spatial data (such as elevation, OSM
 etc.) and real time temporal data.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Lets look at an example focused on public transit bus routing. Table 1
breaks down two separate sets of queries a public transit bus
application may need. First we may need to find all vehicles within a
region. Most databases with spatial extensions can handle this query
within a polygon use case - including document stores and specialized
spatial databases such as ESRI or PostGIS. Case two is an application
that wants to identify bottlenecks along bus routes. This is more
complicated, as we need to combine data from multiple data sources with
various schemas. At this point there are two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Store all data in one data structure. This data structure handles
 all queries. This is most common in practice. Typically a document
 or SQL based store with geospatial indexing is chosen for this
 task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could maintain a spatially indexed data view as well as a graph
 based view. This means we can direct queries depending on the
 optimal data view for the task.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Query 2 represents a case where we need to query highly connected
routing information (in which a graph structure is optimal) while also
needing aggregate queries in which spatially indexed document or SQL
stores are best. The traditional approach as described in approach one
struggles to efficiently store these highly differing data schemas.
Given the high variety of incoming data schemas, extensibility of the
data views is to be a critical component of smart city data
architectures.</p>

<p><strong>3. Current State of the Art</strong></p>

<p>Existing data stores have the ability to aggregate values along spatial
and/or temporal dimensions using indexing structures such as B-tree,
R-tree, KD tree etc. In this context, geo-data types typically consist
of single point values or trajectory paths that are composed of paths of
geo-points. Modern databases including Oracle, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase
and Neo4J provide geo datastores. Additionally, the difficulty in
storing geospatial data has given rise to specialized databases
including Esri and PostGIS that are centered around storing and querying
geo-data quickly and efficiently. To incorporate temporal dimensions
these data stores use time stamps associated with each data value.</p>

<p>Whether using spatial indexing in general purpose databases such as
Oracle, MongoDB ect or working with a specialized geospatial data store
such as Esri and PostGIS there are three primary problems developers
face. First, the variety of approaches tends to result in ad-hoc
solutions in which geospatial storage is tacked on to existing data
stores not optimized for working with such data. Second, it ignores the
high variability of data sources and data schemas associated with a full
smart city data infrastructure implementation. As schemas from different
data sources are often unrelated and challenging to work with, fitting
them into a single type of index or data model makes efficient access to
such data challenging. Lastly, while these storage models are effective
for aggregating values along spatial and/or temporal dimensions, they
fail to capture the correlations between spatial and temporal
dimensions. Spatiotemporal analytics in particular require a
fine-grained understanding of these correlations to build accurate
predictive models. Additionally real time predictions require efficient
querying of such data. These queries often require searching for similar
scenarios based on complex spatio-temporal correlations at a granular
level existing approaches fail to address.</p>

<p>Studies on actual implementation of such systems for smart cities are
limited. Abaker et. al. (2016) outlined the importance of big data in
smart cities and speculated that NoSQL databases would be the primary
data store for such systems. Kaur et al (2019) provided an empirical
discussion of various NoSQL databases for high volume/velocity traffic
data and by process of comparison determined document data stores such
as MongoDB and CouchDB were the preferred data store mechanism for these
types of data. Cheng et. al. (2015) detailed a smart city data and
analytics platform called CiDAP. Their system was centered around
CouchDB and included customly built IoT-broker and application facing
Server for data access. Additionally the system included an optional
data processing component based on HDFS and SPARK. Their analysis
included implementation of the system and a discussion of performance
for varying velocities of incoming data.</p>

<p><strong>4. Our Solution</strong></p>

<p><strong>4.1. Distributed Ledger</strong></p>

<p>Modern smart cities present a high variety of data structures and
sources. This includes well known formats such as Mobility Data
Specification (MDS) for dockless e-scooters and bicycles, GTFS for
public transit as well as vendor specific formats such as ViriCiti
monitoring of bus transport vehicles. The high variation in data
structures presented makes a unified schema for all data sources
impossible. However, all data sources have two shared dimensions: time
and space. In terms of time, each event regardless of data source is
typically timestamped representing a single point in time at which point
that event occurred.</p>

<p>A distributed log/ledger provides an append only data structure in which
new events are added to the ledger as data streams into the system. The
append only structure of distributed ledgers naturally mimics the
temporal nature of incoming smart city data, making it “real-time data’s
unifying abstraction” (Kreps 2013). By storing highly various data in
this fashion, users can obtain data quickly and efficiently across the
unified dimension of time which is ideal for both real-time applications
as well as historical analysis for a given time range.</p>

<p>The governing principle of the distributed ledger is immutable facts.
These immutable facts provide the source of truth from which all other
data stores are derived. The immutable nature of the distributed log
provides strong consistency and replication at the heart of the
spatiotemporal data store architecture. By providing hierarchical
ledgers and locating them in different geographies we can provide access
to real-time streaming data and the structured views (Section 4.3) can
be used for analytical queries that can sustain latency.</p>

<p>In addition to highly variable data structures presented, the method by
which the data is obtained, whether through REST APIs, websockets ect,
is source dependent. As the distributed ledger is the primary data store
for incoming smart city data, a consistent interface and well known
transport methods are required. This is important so that developer time
spent on implementing new data sources does not become a bottleneck as
the overall data storage architecture is expanded and new applications
are built.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Distributed Ledger Implementation</strong></p>

<p>We implemented the distributed ledger using Apache Pulsar (Pulsar
2.4.0). Apache Pulsar is described as the “next-generation pub/sub
messaging system” and was developed at Yahoo (Merli, Ramasamy 2019). In
contrast to similar messaging systems, such as Apache Kafka, Pulsar uses
Apache BookKeeper to implement the ledger in a distributed manner. This
is important as in many smart city applications the volume/velocity of
incoming data is highly variable between data sources. While systems
such as Kafka implement a data store per topic, the distributed nature
of BookKeeper provides a more efficient mechanism for storage in the
ledger.</p>

<p>A second critical aspect of Apache Pulsar is that the processing demands
required from brokers is separated from the storage demands of the
distributed ledger. By separating these two concerns, the system can be
easily scaled in terms of processing and/or storage separately. This
means as demands of the system change, additional processing and/or
storage can be added as needed (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>Lastly, Apache Pulsar provides a variety of well known APIs for data
processing and access. As in our system Apache Pulsar is both a data
processing/steaming tool, as well as the immutable source of truth from
which other systems are derived, we focus on two of the available
workflows in Pulsar. First is the Producer/Reader workflow as shown in
Fig 2. This workflow resembles the traditional smart client - dumb
broker architecture used in other ledger based systems such as Kafka. In
this architecture the clients are required to remember where they are in
the ledger and read data accordingly. This is especially useful for new
client applications that need to catch up to the current point in time,
in which case they can select a previous point in time and read all data
before getting to the new point in time. This makes it very easy to add,
remove or update new client applications or derived storage systems as
needed.</p>

<p>Secondly, we use the Source/Function/Sink architecture as shown in Fig</p>
<ol>
  <li>In this architecture Pulsar itself handles connections to client
applications and derived data stores, in effect creating a smart broker and dumb client architecture. For what this architecture loses in
flexibility (compared to Producer/Reader), it gains in reliability. This
reliability stems from incorporating the business logic within Pulsar
itself where each component is managed by Pulsar’s ZooKeeper. This makes
it ideal for connecting to derived data stores such as MongoDB,
PostgreSQL or Neo4J.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/img/posts/mike/image7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig 1: This shows the separation of brokers and bookies (Apache
BookKeeper nodes) in Apache Pulsar. By separating processing (ie the
Brokers) from the storage units (ie the Bookies), the system can be
scaled separately in terms of processing and storage. In this case, if
additional processing is needed, additional brokers are added while if
additional storage is needed, additional bookies are added. The entire
system is maintained by Apache ZooKeeper. (Ref. Apache Pulsar
Documentation).</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/mike/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig 2: This shows the Pulsar reader interface. The reader interface is
ideal for adding or updating new client applications by providing easy
and customizable access to the distributed ledger. In this way new
clients are customized according to the requirements of the new client,
providing excellent flexibility in new client design.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/mike/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fig 3: Source sink architecture. This architecture mimics the
traditional smart broker - dumb client architecture. By letting Pulsar’s
ZooKeeper manage the business logic associated with data sources, this
architecture provides enhanced reliability making it ideal for
connecting to derived data stores such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL or Neo4J.</p>

<p>Summary of distributed ledger - Pulsar implementation contributions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Distributed ledger provides efficient real time access to data and
querying along temporal dimension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The distributed ledger also provides strong consistency by building
 a log of immutable facts. These immutable facts act as the source
 of truth from which all other data stores are derived.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Source/Function/Sink, Producer/Consumer provide two workflows that
 allow easy implementation of complex new data sources into smart
 city architecture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The separation of processing and storage in Pulsar allows for easy
 scaling, creating a dynamic system to handle the high
 velocity/volume required by current smart city data architectures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security - access to data is granted at the tenant level, allowing
 multiple topics to be grouped into security groups as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>4.3 Derived Structured Data Views</strong></p>

<p>Structured data views are derived from the distributed ledger and can be
used for analytical queries that can sustain latency. As previously
discussed, the distributed ledger is an ideal data structure for
representing the shared time dimension across the various data sources.
The structured data views provide access to the second shared dimension space. For this our prototype architecture has a document based
structured view (MongoDB), and a graph based structured view (Neo4J).</p>

<p>Our MongoDB view represents space through R-Tree geospatial indexing, a
common spatial representation used in specialized geo datastores such as
Esri and PostGIS as well as general purpose data stores such as
PostgreSQL. This data view is highly efficient for aggregate
spatiotemporal queries that can sustain latency. A common use case of
this view is sharing data between colleagues as well as batch processing
and analytics.</p>

<p>The graph view provides an efficient data structure for highly related
spatial data and is provided for complex traversal queries, such as
routing, of the data by storing geospatial network data. To provide
consistency on the data we plan to use Open Street Map (OSM) data to
generate a transportation routing network stored in the Neo4J and then

<p>Fig 4: Spatial representation of data using a graph structure. Here we
map incoming data (in this case dockless scooter trips) to an underlying
OpenStreetMap graph. This data view provides an optimal structure for
representing highly related geospatial data and is used for complex
traversal queries, such as routing.</p>

<p>Fig 5: The global view of the proposed data architecture. The Pulsar
Ledger provides a strongly consistent append only ledger of immutable
facts from which all other systems are derived. The structured data
views provide additional data structures and access APIs for non latency
client applications while the distributed ledger provides real time
access for latency sensitive applications.</p>

<p><strong>5. Extensibility</strong></p>

<p>The modular nature of our data storage system makes it highly
extensible. New data stores such as SQL, Document based, specialized
geospatial stores can be added and removed easily. Additionally, new
data stores can quickly catch up to data by simply reading through the
logs on the topics in which it subscribes to. This makes adding and
removing new structures trivial. The same works for latency-sensitive
client applications, which can attach directly to the distributed log or
to structured data views that are optimized for various data schemas.</p>

<p><strong>6. Current Data Store Status</strong></p>

<p>The current status is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Apache Pulsar system is implemented on six virtual machines at
Vanderbilt. The data itself is distributed across three nodes
(including one degree of redundancy per data source).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two data sources are implemented (Neo4J and MongoDB) and are stored
in ISIS (Vanderbilt) openstack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data sources implemented so far are:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Viriciti data from the transit vehicles in Chattanooga from
    June 2019.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real-time traffic data in Chattanooga at a frequency of one
    minute update from May-march 2019 and July 2019-August 2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The high resolution elevation data for Chattanooga cross referenced
    with open street maps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are working on integrating the weather data</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Analysis in Progress Using the Data</strong></p>

<p><ins>Data Curation (GPS Error Resolution and Elevation Data) </ins></p>

<p>The vehicle location traces collected by ViriCiti using GPS are
inherently noisy. Due to this noise, some of the recorded locations
erroneously fall onto streets or parking lots that are adjacent to the
streets where the vehicles actually travel. To map the noisy GPS
coordinates to the correct streets, we combined the location traces with
street-level maps obtained from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for the City of
Chattanooga. For a particular GPS coordinate, we considered the list of
nearby streets and compared them with the streets that are nearby prior
and posterior coordinates from the location trace. We then mapped the
GPS coordinate to a particular street based on both frequency and street
types. The following figure shows the mapping of GPS coordinates to
streets, where blue nodes represent the GPS coordinates from ViriCity,
and red polygons represent the selected streets. Each separate polygon
represents a distinct OSM road segment with a unique OSM identifier. For
energy usage prediction, we combined the location traces with the
correct street-level information, such as the type of the road, whether
there is a tunnel or not, whether the road is two-way or one-way, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/mike/image6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To reliably predict fuel or energy consumption, we need to consider the
elevation of the route on which the vehicle is travelling. When the bus
travels uphill, it may consume more energy and time than when it travels
downhill. So, we also combined the location traces and street-level data
with accurate elevation data. We used OSM street-level maps for fetching
the horizontal locations of streets, parking lots, etc., and an accurate
topographic map to collect information about land elevation of feature.</p>

<p><ins>Generic Prediction Model for Energy Consumption  </ins></p>

<p>We used one month of data from ViriCity for an electric vehicle (BYD
752) and combined the GPS coordinates with street-level and elevation
data. To prepare the data for training, we first segmented the location
trace of the bus into disjoint samples. A sample is a continuous,
maximal-length interval in which the bus travelled on a particular road
(i.e., OSM road segment). We considered the distance between the first
and last recorded GPS coordinates in the sample, the change in
elevation, the type of road (includes different streets such as primary,
trunk, service, residential etc.), etc. as the input features for
prediction. We also took the first and last logged battery State of
Charge for each sample, and considered the energy consumed to be the
target feature for prediction.</p>

<p>We have tried three different approaches for our prediction model:
Linear Regression, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Support Vector
Regression. Among these approaches, Feed-Forward Neural Network works
best with the lowest average mean squared error (0.072). The following
figure shows the predicted and actual values for 50 samples.<br />

<p>We are working on extending our model to consider hybrid vehicles as well.</p>
